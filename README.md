###What you'll find:

- really cool and easy to get cli
- bearable and comfortable to use UI
- option to play vs friend
- option to play vs easy/hard AI
- load/save game

###Tests

- full Board test coverage
- full AI    test coverage
- excellent GameController test coverage
- lacks cli test coverage
- lacks ui  test coverage
